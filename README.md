# Precourse: Recursion

A **recursive function** is one that calls itself üìû. In this assignment you will use recursion to solve three problems.

## Objectives

In this assignment you will use JavaScript and recursion to:

- create possible hands üñê for _Rock, Paper, Scissors_.
- traverse the DOM and get elements by their class name.
- turn JavaScript values into JSON strings.

## Instructions

- Fork üç¥ and clone this repository following the Code Chrysalis git flow instructions.
- Open the `index.html` file in your browser. You will see a list of failing tests.
- Commit your work often.
- When you have completed all the tasks, follow the Code Chrysalis git flow instructions to create a `pull request`.

## Basic Requirements

Write code in the `src/rockPaperScissors.js`, `src/getElementByClassName.js`, and `src/stringifyJSON.js` files to make the tests pass.

* [ ] `rockPaperScissors`: ü§ò üìÑ ‚úÇÔ∏è Generate permutations of the game _Rock, Paper, Scissors_.
  - [ ] Read blog posts on recursion: [Part 1](http://blog.fanofyan.com/recursion/) and [Part 2](http://blog.fanofyan.com/recursion-with-javascript-pt-2/)
* [ ] `getElementByClassName`: A practical instance of recursion. The **DOM** is a üå≥ tree structure and recursion is an efficient way to traverse it.
  * See links provided in Resources for some help
* [ ] `stringifyJSON`: Also a very practical use of recursion. We will be recreating the `JSON.stringify` method, which converts a JavaScript value to a **JSON** string.
